AIRCRAFT BUSINESS DECISION BADES ON THE ACCIDENT DATA COLLECTED
The abobe was my project tittle

THE DATA WAS PROVIDED FRO THE ONLINE

I FORMULATED THE OBJECTIVES AS FOLLOWS
TO OBTAIN THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE LEADING NUMBER OF INJURIES WITH THE ACCURATE FIGURE
TO OBTAIN THE MINIMUM FIGURE OF THE INJURIES ATAINED IN THE AIRCRAFT
TO OBTAIN THE AIRCRAFT THAT HAD MINOR/MAJOR INJURIES/INCIDENTS
TO OBTAINE THE AIRCRAFT PURPOSED FOR BUSINESS AND ARE OF INCIDENTS INJURIES
TO VISUALISE THE FEW LEADING AIRCRAFTS WITH THE NUMBER OF INJURIESTO GIVE OUT THE RESULT FINDINGS
TO GIVE OUT THE RECOMENDATIONS

MY DATA OUTLOOK WAS AS FOLLOW
The data was a csv file
Had 88889 rows and 31 columns
Have massive null values and with missed data typed issues encounter in several columns
The data contained objects and floats

I ENSURED THAT I WORKED ON THE DATA TO THE FOLLOWINGS
To do away with the null values
To create appropriate data columns
To obtain specific data from the dataset

EVENTUALLY I WAS ABLE TO COME OUT WITH THE FOLLOWING FOUNDINGS
1.0 FROM CALCULATIONS
The maximun number of injuries obtained was 576 and zero (0) as minimum 
The majority of the aircrafts investigated had no injuries with a minimum of zero 0 injuries
There were 355 investigated cases that had minor damage on the aircraft
Checking on the injury severity, only 71 aircraft had an incident
For the aircrafts with incident injuries, non of them were made for business purposes-for the business aircraft, only 4 aircrafts withe minor aircraft damage were found
The aircrafts with injuries greater than 530 as the last leading aircrafts were 8 and thus the most worse cases very risky to invest on
From the visualisation, its clear that the aircrafts of mode no: 747-sp and 747-4f6b are the most worse cases ever from the investigation.

2.0 FROM VISUALIZATIONS
Aircrafts with the RECIPROCATING engine type had coused a masive TOTAL FELAT INJURIES.
The aircraft which had the engine type of 737 was the worse model ever that coused the MASIVE TOTAL FETAL INJURIES that was just but ubnormal thus the worse to use
For the weather condition VMC, contributed greately the the masive TOTAL FELAT INJURIES experienced and thus thus be of caution
The higher the altitude the greator the masive TOTAL FETAL INJURIES experienced
The aircrafts purpose greatly contribute to the huge num ber of the TOTAL FETAL INJURIES as exposed by the personal purposed one.
